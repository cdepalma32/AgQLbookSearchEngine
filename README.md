  ## Description
  This application uses a functioning Google Books API search engine originally built with a RESTful API and refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. <br>
  The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. <br>
  The Apollo Server was set up and configured to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.<br>
  Then, the existing authentication middleware was modified, so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API. <br>
  Lastly, an Apollo Provider was created so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server. <br><br>
  User Story:<br>
  As an avid reader <br>
  I WANT to search for new books to read <br>
  SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase.
